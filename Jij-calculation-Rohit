I followed the following video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhi7lpmBJeE
We need to sample the entire BZ for Jij calculations, so the symcof file needs to be modified.

cd bz
cp ../symcof lowsym
vi lowsym (change symmetry operation number to 1, it's the second line of the file)
run cub (remember to select lowsym file instead of default symcof and say "no" to message ...add time-reversal...while running and also use same set of points)
cd ../link_spts new_kpoint
{extra: in data file change integration scheme, use zero (0) at line 10 of data file } 

The green.inp file is also required. We can use the shell script provided at https://github.com/ykvashnin/rspt-tutorial/blob/main/7/init_jijs.sh 

Then single rspt run.
